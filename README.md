Reproducible scripts and notebooks for 2019 paper on population genetics in metagenomes

## Structure

*inStrain_lite* - A `pip` installable python program that will call SNPs and calculate nucleotide diversity, linkage, coverage+breadth, and Fst.
Meant to be reusable for other projects, eventually will be published as its own independent repository. 

*Data* - contains some of the usable data files for this paper.

*Notebooks* - notebooks used to generate each figure in this paper.
